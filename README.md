# Welcome to Aliens-attack
## Game in the style of a classic space battle
I present to your attention a game project (v. 0.0.1, initial stage of development) ALiens-attack. This is a simple game in the style of classic space battles.

The game is written in Python. To play, you need to install PyGame traffic.

At the moment, the game has the ability to select the level of difficulty, the movement of the ship horizontally. Press "Space" to fire a shot. Press "Q" to exit the game.
New features will be added soon!
### It should be noted that now the game works optimally only with a FULL HD screen resolution!

#### Here are some pictures:
